                <p>Hi I'm Mark Steven Langhamer Jr. I am 25 year old and an aspiring Web Developer from Westmont, IL! Before I got into coding I was a Pre-Pharm major and I still currently work in pharmacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My main hobbies include going to the gym, music production, singing, going to concerts, cooking, and of course coding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My interests in regards to coding involve gaming and music production. In regards to gaming I would love to work on MMORPGs like World of Warcraft.
                    Music production wise I hope to develop plug-ins for production software such as Ableton.
                </p>
